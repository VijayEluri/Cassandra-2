0.4 dev
 * Thrift API has changed a _lot_:
    - removed colon-delimited strings in thrift api in favor of explicit
      structs such as ColumnPath, ColumnParent, etc.  Also normalized
      thrift struct and argument naming.
    - Added columnFamily argument to get_key_range.
    - Change signature of get_slice and get_slice_super to accept
      starting and ending columns as well as an offset.  (This allows use
      of indexes.)  Added "ascending" flag to allow reasonably-efficient
      reverse scans as well.  Removed get_slice_by_range as redundant.
    - Similarly, changed signature of get_slice_super.
 * Removed the web interface. Node information can now be obtained by 
   using the newly introduced nodeprobe utility.


0.3.0 RC3
 * Fix potential deadlock under load in TCPConnection.
   (CASSANDRA-220)

0.3.0 RC2
 * Fix possible data loss when server is stopped after replaying
   log but before new inserts force memtable flush.
   (CASSANDRA-204)
 * Added BUGS file

0.3.0 RC1
 * Range queries on keys, including user-defined key collation
 * Remove support
 * Workarounds for a weird bug in JDK select/register that seems
   particularly common on VM environments. Cassandra should deploy
   fine on EC2 now
 * Much improved infrastructure: the beginnings of a decent test suite
   ("ant test" for unit tests; "nosetests" for system tests), code
   coverage reporting, etc.
 * Expanded node status reporting via JMX
 * Improved error reporting/logging on both server and client
 * Reduced memory footprint in default configuration
 * Combined blocking and non-blocking versions of insert APIs
 * Added FlushPeriodInMinutes configuration parameter to force
   flushing of infrequently-updated ColumnFamilies
