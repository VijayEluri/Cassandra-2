0.4 dev
 * Added columnFamily argument to get_key_range.
 * Change signature of get_slice and get_slice_super to accept
   starting and ending columns as well as an offset.  (This allows use
   of indexes.)  Added "ascending" flag to allow reasonably-efficient
   reverse scans as well.  Removed get_slice_by_range as redundant.
 * Similarly, changed signature of get_slice_super.
 * Removed the web interface. Node information can now be obtained by 
   using the newly introduced nodeprobe utility.


0.3.0

 * Range queries on keys, including user-defined key collation
 * Remove support
 * Workarounds for a weird bug in JDK select/register that seems
   particularly common on VM environments. Cassandra should deploy
   fine on EC2 now
 * Much improved infrastructure: the beginnings of a decent test suite
   ("ant test" for unit tests; "nosetests" for system tests), code
   coverage reporting, etc.
 * Expanded node status reporting via JMX
 * Improved error reporting/logging on both server and client
 * Reduced memory footprint in default configuration
 * Combined blocking and non-blocking versions of insert APIs
 * Added FlushPeriodInMinutes configuration parameter to force
   flushing of infrequently-updated ColumnFamilies
